# Windows Server 2022 – OS Project

## INSTALLATION

This project explains how to install Windows Server 2022 using Oracle VirtualBox. It includes steps like setting up a virtual machine, loading the ISO file, and following the installation wizard. Key tasks include choosing server roles, setting up a user account, and configuring the network. The goal is to get a clean and working server environment for learning. It's a simple way to explore Windows Server features without using a real server.

## SYSTEM CALL IMPLEMENTATION

The system call explored in this project is `accept()`, which helps a server listen and respond to client connections. It’s part of the Winsock API in Windows and is commonly used in socket programming. When a client tries to connect, `accept()` creates a new socket to handle that specific connection. This is useful in apps like web servers that need to talk to many users at once. It is a basic but powerful tool for building networked software.
